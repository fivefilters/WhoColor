# whoCOLOR
The whoCOLOR userscript colors Wikipedia articles based on by-word authorship.

**NEW**: We are currently working on a new API for the colored markupÂ´etc. that the userscript consumes (see the "dev" branch for now). this includes providing new server-side components in Python instead of PHP and an updated userscript. This will become the main branch soon, deprecating the current PHP version. 



Take a look at http://f-squared.org/whovisual/ for more information.
